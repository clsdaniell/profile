## OlÃ¡! Eu sou Carlos Daniel de Oliveira
<p>
  ðŸ–¥ I'm a QA professional with 3 years of experience in manual and automated testing, always aiming for reliability and value delivery. During my career, I worked on temporary projects in conjunction with full-time contracts, acquiring skills in time management, adaptability, effective communication and flexibility.

I have knowledge in automated API tests with Postman and Cypress, as well as in automated frontend tests with Cypress. My main skill is the automation of API tests, in which I have experience with Cypress, as well as knowledge in Cucumber and Allure reporter. I also have knowledge in agile methods, such as Scrum and Kanban, for agile project delivery.

As soft skills, I have flexibility, good communication, sense of leadership, ethics, team spirit, analytical skills, resilience and agile mindset, as well as an ease of continuous learning, especially with practical activities.

I have a sense of ownership for quality assurance throughout the SDLC cycle, taking the concept of shift-left testing and evangelizing the team with software quality and DevOps concepts to increase application maturity.

  ðŸ–¥ I am always in search of new knowledge. 'Knowledge is in itself a power.'
